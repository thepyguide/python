# Pull Requests

!!! note

    Basic knowledge of [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) and GitHub
    is required and assumed.


If you're looking to fixing an issue, improving or contributing a new
section, this section is for you.

To start, [fork the GitHub repository](https://github.com/thepyguide/
thepyguide.github.io/fork) and clone it. It is recommended to create a new 
branch in your fork to avoid conflicts and commit history issues.

To create a new branch, run the following commands in your cloned fork
git repository:
```
$ git checkout -b put-branch-name-here
```

Push the changes and open a new pull request.

## Guidelines
- All pull requests should point to the `main` branch.
- It is recommended to use past tense in your commit messages for consistency
  purposes.
- Make sure to keep the scope pull request minimal. A single pull request
  should focus on a single issue instead of many issues.

Above guidelines are not strict rules and any issues in pull requests
will be addressed while merging.
