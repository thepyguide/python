# 2.3. Comments
When writing a complex program, your code will surely get complicated at some point. A
code is read much more often than it is written. Hence it is important that you ensure
that others can understand your code.

This is when comments are helpful. As the name suggests, comments are simply line of
codes which solely exist to explain your code. These lines are ignored at execution
time. In order to write a comment, start a line by a `#` symbol.

For example,

```py
# This is a comment
print('This is a normal line of code')
```

In this code, the first line is a comment which will be ignored during execution.

Comments are used to include useful information in code which will help others reading
your code. It is a good practice to add comments when you think your code could be too
complicated to comprehend by a human.

When working with programs, especially investigating errors or bugs in code, it is a common
practice to use comments to temporarily prevent a piece of code to execute by commenting
out that bit of code.

As you'll notice in next articles, we'll use comments throughout this guide for
explaining the code snippets included in articles and we hope you do to in your code.
