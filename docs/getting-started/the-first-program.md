# 1.3. Hello, World!
Now that we have installed Python and setup a Python environment, we can proceed to write our
first program. The moment of truth.

Create a new file in your code editor or IDE and name it `main.py`. In this file, include
your first line of Python code:

```py
print('Hello, World!')
```

Yep, that's it. That's the most basic Python program that outputs the given message
on screen (`Hello, World` in this case).

Run this program from your code editor or command line. If you're using one of the editors
listed in [1.2. Python Environments](./python-environments.md), it should
provide a "Run Code" button. If not, you can execute the following command in the terminal:

```
$ python main.py
```

You should see the following output:

```
Hello, World!
```

_Voil√†!_ Congratulations on successfully running your first program!

## The `print` statement

Let us understand what is going in this single line of code. We're using the `print` function
here. This function is used to output the given message. Throughout this guide, you'll notice
we extensively use this function.

We are calling `print` function with the message to output inside brackets, enclosed in quotes.
It is important to enclose the message in quotes. We'll learn more about this in the next section.
