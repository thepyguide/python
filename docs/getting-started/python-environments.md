# 1.2. Python Environments
When it comes to writing Python programs, you need a code editor or IDE to do so.

Technically, a notepad can be used too but using a code editor is the preferred way as it
provides features that are almost essential for a smooth programming experience.

If you have experience with programming, you are probably already aware of setting up
code editor or IDE. In case not, this page is for you.

There are many choices of editors that you can use. We recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).
